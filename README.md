## Acknowledgment

This project could not be possible without the help of Wolfram Kriesing who, in a really generous way, shared his code with me. I am very grateful for his help and support.

## How does it work?

There are two folders in this project:

 - js-features
 - coding-patterns

 Each folder contains a set of projects which are used to test the features and patterns. The projects are named after the feature or pattern they are testing. For example, the project `js-features/arrow-functions` is used to test the arrow functions feature. All the tests in each project fail. The goal is to make them pass by using the feature or pattern they are testing.
